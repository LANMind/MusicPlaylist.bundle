MusicPlaylist.bundle
====================

Music playlist plugin for Plex Media Server


NOTES:
   1. Info.plist:  <PlexPluginCodePolicy> currently set to "Elevated"
      ==> This plugin queries the metadata from the PMS server.
          This gives a permission denied unless the security is set to "Elevated"

   2. 'On Deck' functionality does not work on Plex Windows Desktop Client.
      It is tested on windows 8 phone and wwen client

   3. A standalone application for managing the playlists is also availabel.
      This is a Windows application that requires .NET framework version 4.0.
      It is available at: https://github.com/cp9999/MusicPlaylistManager.git
